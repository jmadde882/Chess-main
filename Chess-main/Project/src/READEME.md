SE 576: Software Reliability and Testing - Chess compute legal move

I make test case in com.Chess.ChessMoveTest class
We can run this test case by Junit 5 in Intellij or Eclipse
All test case are passed.

We can run ChessMove.java file .
So you can see like result : LEGAL MOVES FOR Rf1: e1, d1, c1, b1, a1
If you want to test other chess board or piece, you can change input string in line 298.
